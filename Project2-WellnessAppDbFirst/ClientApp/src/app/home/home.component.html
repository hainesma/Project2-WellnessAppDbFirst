<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
  <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
  <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
  <li><strong>Angular CLI integration</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run <code>ng serve</code>. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration automatically invokes <code>ng build</code> to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.</p>



<!--These components are only added in as API testing remnants, they currently function but this home page is not where they would actually be stored,
  Once we start to reconfigure the front end towards its final form these will have to be moved to the dashboard, and the User registration/Log in splash
  Should be the first page as I understand currently -Troy-->

  <!--I didn't know what to put for this front page really so I just grabbed a stock photo that was free to
    for commercial purposes w/out attribution, I don't really have any attachment to this picture simply a place holder'!-->

<!--I think the *ngIf with the async pipe should load this div if the user is logged in but i'm not sure 100% and I can't test it from
  this IP address-->
